## Reflection Document

### HTML

- Completed most of the exercises on my own in this section. The articles that were listed for Week 2 were very helpful like the lists, navigation, tables, and forms articles which provided enough information and examples to finish the tasks.
- I think most of the exercises were helpful in getting started with html. I'd say my favorite exercise was exercise 04 - form. This exercise contained labels, inputs, legends, and fieldsets to complete.
  - I was able to get a good understanding of what was expected using the form article but I did need additional help using the video to fully complete.

### Accessibility

- This exercise expanded on the previous week's exercise 04 - form except focusing on accessibility. The main difference is placing certain elements in the correct place and giving more user friendly options.
- One of the required features was to include default text for input boxes such as the name and the email which included default values that serve as examples.
- I think the most helpful part of this exercise is understanding how the radio button works for a series of options. The biggest takeaway is setting a universal name for each radio button within a series to prevent more than one option being highlighted at a given time. The problem with failing to do so is each button would work as a standalone button as opposed to giving the user options for one "question".

### CSS

- Most of these exercises were completed with the help of the provided videos.
- These exercises seem to be very helpful since we're always going to be using css and this lab was really good practice.
- For the most part, I found most exercises very useful. Selectors was good to get a better understanding of how to select a particular element, layout was useful because it helps you break up a page into a grid and moves elements around into their own "box", and position was always useful for this reason but it worked with positions like absolute, static, relative, and fixed.
  - I think the most useful exercise was the media queries one because it gave a good insight on the navbar while also giving practice on setting new behavior at a given screen size.

### Flexbox

- Flexbox was a really interesting exercise because it goes more in depth about position elements around a page. This seems very beneficial because good practice with this skill means an easier time with designing a web page. This is because you'd know exactly how to select an element and move it where you need to.
  - Part of what made this exercise challenging is figuring out how to properly use flex-direction, flex-flow, flex-direction, and align-items. This is because there are many selections that go into each of these options.
- Given the challenge of this exercise, I think the articles listed and the lecture of flexbox does do a good job on describing the various functions we can use to finish the exercise.

### CSS-Grid

- This week's lab was similar to CSS and the Flexbox lab's in that it gives more practice with moving elements. This time we used grid containers to select a specific elements on the page and grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows to change the appearance of each container.
- Most of the exercises were completed using the videos for the lab.
- I think the most helpful exercise was grid-areas because it really gives you an idea on how you can structure elements around a page with the header, article, aside, section, and footer at the bottom. What's also helpful is utilizng the @media property to stylize the page at different screen sizes.

### Bootstrap

- Most of the exercises were completed using the videos associated with the lab.
- I found the most helpful exercises in this lab to be cards and modal. The exercises in this lab accomplished the sytling mostly in html utilizing bootstrap. We used a good amount of options in this lab but there are many more to choose from.
  - "float-sm-right" floats small screens to the right with options -md -lg and -xl
  - w-25 is width 25% going up to 100% and mw for maxwidth.
  - h-25 works with the height of an element and mh can be used for maxheight.
  - cards was useful because it accomplishes a task we've done before except without the use of css. This comes in handy when you know you want to structure an element a particular way and css would be beneficial only later when you need more flexibility.
  - modal was the first time we encountered a button that can open a new piece of content that can also close clicking anywhere outside of the new box or by clicking the 'x' within the box, and all of this was done using bootstrap options.

### Javascript

- The exercises were completed using the associated videos.
- Exercise 04-dom was helpful for getting experience with `addEventListener`, `querySelector`, adding and appending elements to a `section`, and handling user input to the dom.
  - Deconstructing also seemed very helpful because there may be many times were parsing data can come in handy. We can also change the way we interact with an input via `{ name }` and where it's coming from. Ex: `const { first_name } = input`
  - This is helpful because now, instead of having to access the data through `input` we can just call `first_name`.
- I would say the most helpful exercise was fetch because it really ties in with the expectations on hw3 as it deals with grabbing data and creating html elements and styling as needed.

### Jquery

- I used the videos to finish these exercises.
- I ran into some issues with the code from the videos so I had to practice using the solutions from github. Now, from exercise 1 the program will correctly copy over.
- Exercise 02-ajax seemed very helpful since it reduces the amount of code we need to write that accomplishes the same thing as exercise 06 from javascript lab.
- I think the slides did cover enough to finish the exercise including the jQuery pdf.
- If there is one thing I could change for this week's lab, I think it would just be a little more practice.
